# CanSat_Aetos

For the CanSat in Greece 2020 competition, one of my responsibilities besides creating the team's website was to create a Node.js server. The project had as main mission to collect data from different sensors ( like temperature, altitude, gps, etc.) using an Arduino board and our original idea was to represent this data live in a website. So, I created the server and website, that accessed the data from the arduino board and represented tehm in graphs, using the Chart.js library. Visit my teams' website: http://lyk-peir-patras.ach.sch.gr/cansat/aetos20/

Folders:
- Arduino: The code from the arduino boards. We used 3 arduinos, 2 in the CanSat Sattelite and 1 for the Server in the Base.
- aetos web2: The second version of our team's website, that you can find at this link : http://lyk-peir-patras.ach.sch.gr/cansat/aetos20/
- server: In this folder is included the Javascript code for the Server, and also the Live-Website, that unfortunately is not live at the momemnt :(

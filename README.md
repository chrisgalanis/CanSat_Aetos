# CanSat_Aetos

For the CanSat in Greece 2020 competition, one of my responsibilities besides creating the team's website was to create a Node.js server. The project had as main mission to collect data from different sensors ( like temperature, altitude, gps, etc.) using an Arduino board and our original idea was to represent this data live in a website. So, I created the server and website, that accessed the data from the arduino board and represented tehm in graphs, using the Chart.js library. \href{http://lyk-peir-patras.ach.sch.gr/cansat/aetos20/}{Visit my teams' website
